# Telecommunications Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn for a California-based telecommunications provider with 7,043 customers. The work focuses on understanding churn drivers, customer profiles (churned, joined, stayed), and retention opportunities using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and segmentation.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (data analysis and scripting)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (interactive analysis workflow)
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** (data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation)
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** (visualizations for EDA)
- **Microsoft PowerPoint** (final insights and stakeholder presentation)

## Achievements & Results
- **Documented customer status distribution** to quantify churn vs. join vs. stay behavior.
- **Identified contract-type churn risk**, highlighting that **month-to-month contracts show the highest churn rates**.
- **Analyzed pricing impact**, finding that **churned customers pay higher monthly charges** on average.
- **Flagged high-value risk**, noting that **high-value customers are disproportionately represented among churned users**.
- **Built a consolidated dataset** with cleaned and standardized fields to support repeatable analysis and reporting.

## Deliverables
- `Python_Data_Analytics.ipynb`: full data cleaning, EDA, and visualization workflow.
- `Business_Case_Study.pptx`: executive summary and insights deck.
- `Data_Analytics_Report.pdf`: written report (summary of results and recommendations).
